copy full folder containing repository (of course with .git files)

configure all your git stuff (name, email, ssh keys and so on)

go to folder

$git status

this shows all the files as files which have been modified
do:

$git checkout .

this ensures that the files go to their last repository version

with 

$git pull

check that this is indeed the case

You need gfortran and developer libraries for gsl.

go to ext/Makefile

and add the correct directory that leads to your MathLink (mathematica) installation in the line:

MLINKDIR = /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/9.0/SystemFiles/Links/MathLink/DeveloperKit

go to ext/camb and make sure that the Makefile points to the correct gfortran paths.


In ext/halofit/Makefile do this if you get an error message of libraries:
put the library flags beyond the .o files:

$(CC) -o smith2demo smith2demo.o smith2.o $(lflags)
